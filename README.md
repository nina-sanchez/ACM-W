# ACM-W
hello! this is a repo with different files written in C++. They go over the basic loops in C++ as well as a file with some debugging needs.

if you have downloaded VS Code and it is able to run cpp files, run these in the terminal to run program:
  1. g++ <filename.cpp>
  2. ./a.out
  this should compile and execute the program

if you do not have vs code, no worries! you can use a free online gdb to run the programs:
  https://www.onlinegdb.com
  - select language to c++


copy + paste the code from the file of your choice into vs code or online gdb

* for those who are experienced with C++, you can tackle some leetcode problems
